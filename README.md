# The Bouncy Castle Crypto Package For Java, but less

Forked from the giant bouncy castle repo, I present that same repo if you removed 90% of it!

# What's gone

What did I remove? I don't even remember, too much, most modules and code, checkstyle, a lot of tests, bug checkers, etc.
For what it was before my delete button got worn out, look at commit 5efa911ba5750de1439e0d575ecc9e39139858c9 of
the original repo at https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java
